# Math Studies

The objective of this repository is to become a journal of my progress in studying Math topics mostly related to computer graphics and games. As an enthusiast of those two disciplines, I have quickly learned that Math is essential for having a solid base that would enable me to bring to life my creations. I'll compile the intuitions behind certain math concepts here and try my best to create interactive examples to complement my notes.

My goal is to have a daily consistency on my study journey as this will help with retention of the content. I'll also be refining certain topics and creating links whenever is possible.
